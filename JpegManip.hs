   Status report:
   I did solved questions 1, 2 and 3. I'm not aware of any bugs.
   Everything works but the checksum calculation is a bit slow.

   I'm using a package called exif-3000.0.0 from hackage
   for reading exif data:
   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/exif-3000.0.0

   I read about how to convert integers to hex here:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1959715/how-
   to-print-integer-literals-in-binary-or-hex-in-haskell

   The handout clearly stated this program should not take
   any input. So I defined the list of files to process as
   the function "files" below. This requires the pictures to
   be in a folder called pics.

   I'm a but curious to if the function "pickOut" is really needed.
   It feels like I might be doing something wrong there?
   Going from IO [IO String] -> IO [String] seems a bit awkward
   when having to do it manually like this.

   The handout says the thumbnail should be 128 px wide. I also
   assume the height should be 128px.

   I used http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/
   gd/3000.4.0/doc/html/Graphics-GD.html
   to do the actual jpeg size manipulation. It's super easy
   to use.

   This was a very fun assignment! ^_^

   keep the one called DateTimeDigitized

   Receive a list of dates, a list of filenames and put the

   Calculate the checksum for a file
-}
calcCheckSum :: FilePath -> IO ()
calcCheckSum str = do
  file <- C.readFile str
  putStrLn $ showIntAtBase 16 intToDigit (eatBytes file) ""

{-
   At first I had a really complex function for this.

   I ran unpack to get a String back, then I converted each
   char to an Int, then I summed everything. It usually took
   1 min 11 secs to calculate the checksum for a picture.
   O(n^3) or something I think.

   Now I just sum everything from the beginning of the
   ByteString/list. With this approach it usually takes
   12 seconds (1 min better!). O(n) now?

   part of it's name when put as "blabal/name.blabla"
