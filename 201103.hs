{-
In computer science, denotational semantics (initially known as mathematical
semantics or Scottâ€“Strachey semantics) is an approach of formalizing the
meanings of programming languages by constructing mathematical objects
(called denotations) that describe the meanings of expressions from
the languages.
-}

{-
Operational semantics are a category of formal programming language semantics
in which certain desired properties of a program, such as correctness,
safety or security, are verified by constructing proofs from logical statements
about its execution and procedures, rather than by attaching mathematical
meanings to its terms (denotational semantics). Operational semantics are
classified in two categories: structural operational semantics (or small-step
semantics) formally describe how the individual steps of a computation take
place in a computer-based system. By opposition natural semantics
(or big-step semantics) describe how the overall results of the executions
are obtained. Other approaches to providing a formal semantics of programming
languages include axiomatic semantics and denotational semantics.

{-
    The system waits because there is no point in retrying if the value does
    not change. The transaction is still negative/illegal.

    Yes, if the new value is negative we will try again.
