This is where I put mixed code experiments.
Mostly in functional programming. And stuff...
<br/>
How to see where gcc loads linked C libaries from: <br/>
gcc -print-prog-name=cc1` -v <br/>
<br/>
gcc -lSOMETHING means load libary "libSOMETHING"<br/>
and not load executable SOMETHING...<br/>
<br/>
gcc -lexif loads C library exif.<br/>
gcc -I (capital i) "some library" includes it
